In this assignment, I have worked with the publicly available dataset: A Global Database of COVID-19 Vaccinations.
Link to github: https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/vaccinations

The purpose of this project was to get real world experience of designing the database and implementing queries based on certain questions that simulated real world queries.
The above link will also contain README.md which will give the description of all the files. https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/blob/master/public/data/vaccinations/README.md

What I achieved working on this project:
• Designed and implemented a database system to manage and analyse large datasets of COVID-19 vaccinations. 
• Developed complex SQL queries to extract, manipulate, and analyse data efficiently. 
• Retrieved and visualized data using advanced querying and reporting tools, enhancing data accessibility and insights.
